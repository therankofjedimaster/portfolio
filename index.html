                        In this video game, submitted for the Godot Wild Jam #50, I was responsible for all sound
                        effects
                        and music. <br> The sound effects were created by using various virtual instruments and
                        manipulating
                        the envelopes and filters on them. <br>
                        The music was achieved by combining various pre-owned loops, as well as adding self-made pad
                        layers
                        and composing some short melodic lines alone.

                        Creating
                        the wing sounds for the flying character was particularly interesting, and it involved white

                        manipulation through filters and modulation.

                        and music. <br> The approach to sound effects here included both virtual instruments as well
                        as the
                        manipulation of foley effects (self-recorded and library sourced). <br> The music, much like
                        in
                        "Lightkeeper's Ritual", is a mix of library-owned loops, self-created pads, and short
                        self-performed, self-created melody lines mixed with pre-existing material.

                    <p>
                        This Christmas themed shooter was made for the 7dfps 2023 Game Jam during the Christmas
                        holidays.
                        All SFX are created by me (incluidng the vocal ones), or sourced from libraries and
                        subsequently
                        edited by me. I also
                        contributed to game design ideas for this game, such as adding certain props, weapons and
                        mechanics.
                        <br> As of January 2024, the game is still in prototype phase. As in other games, the sound
                        implementation was not done by me, but rather by the programmers of the game.

                        giving a
                        human voice a robot effect, and composing music reminiscent of that used in the Star Wars
